                    For 4 years at DePaul I studied and formed a solid
                    understanding of all things software and development.
                    Learning multiple languages and adding tools to my belt
                    allowed me to decide what kind of developer I wanted to be.

                    COVID hit the last few weeks of class and a few of my finals
                    were taken online instead of at campus. My commencement was
                    now a YouTube video instead of your traditional walk
                    ceremony. But I finally finished and received my BS in CS
                    and was on to bigger and better things.

                    After I was freed from the shackles of school I started to
                    explore other areas of my profession. I started working with
                    HTML and CSS and JS more in my experiments and projects. It
                    seemed like web development was a fun and fast paced area of
                    software development that I enjoyed the most.

                    I continued to develope my skills in the area of web
                    development. Honing in my HTML/CSS/JS knowledge and
                    abilities. Eventually I found my foot in the door of a
                    digital marketing and website management company called
                    Officite. Here I am able to use my knowledge on actual
                    client websites and learn more about design patterns and the
                    culture of office life at a large business. It is the
                    perfect place for a FED who was just starting out.

                    After a year at Officite I moved on to a new company called
                    Boost Auto Parts. Here I continued to sharpen my skills in a
                    fast pace and challenging work environment. I was able to
                    learn many new technologies and tools that I had not used
                    before. My knowledge of the world of ecommerece grew
                    rapidly.
