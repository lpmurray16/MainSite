				<p>
					In my role as a FED at HS1/Officite my knowledge of
					HTML5/CSS3/JS grew significantly on top of what I had
					learned through school and in making
					personal projects. This website being one of them.

				<p>
					React and React.js have been increasingly popular
					and I was told if you want to make it in the FED or
					web development world you have to learn a framework
					(even though React is a library).

				<p>
					Most of my classes at DePaul were taught in Java.
					Data Structures and OOP were primarily taught in
					Java while my systems classes were all C/C++. I do
					not enjoy C/C++ as much as I enjoy Java.

				<h2>Python</h2>

			<div class="card_bottom">
				<p>
					Python is one of those hate to love programming
					languages for me. It is so simple and relaxed with
					its syntax that sometimes I forget I am programming
					at all. But it is very useful and has a Swiss Army
					Knife of usability.

			<div class="card_bottom">
				<p>
					Database Management was a fun and challenging course
					for me at DePaul. And although we used Oracle PL/SQL
					throughout the course I have found that it's good

					MySQL.

					WordPress is very fun to experiment with and in my
					CMS class we learned a lot of just how capable
					WordPress is as a web building platform. We even
					learned some PHP and made our own plugins.
